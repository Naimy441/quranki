/**
 * Matches Quranki's study words/phrases (src/data/quranic-words.json) against every word of
 * the Qur'an, so the reader can know which on-screen words the user has already studied - and
 * later, whether they've mastered them - in order to hide/reveal their word-by-word translation.
 *
 * A citation-form vocabulary word (e.g. the verb "هَدَى") doesn't literally reappear everywhere
 * it's relevant - Arabic morphology means the same word surfaces as many different letter
 * sequences ("يَهْدِى", "اهْتَدَىٰ", "هُدًى", "مُهْتَدٍ", ...), and nouns are almost always fused
 * with a leading "ال" or other single-letter prefixes with no space ("الشَّمْس" is one Qur'an
 * word, not "شَمْس" with a separate "ال"). Simple diacritic-insensitive string matching alone
 * only reaches ~20k of the deck's documented 64,282-word coverage for exactly this reason.
 *
 * To close that gap, this uses the Qur'anic Arabic Corpus's morphological segmentation
 * (scripts/data/quran-morphology.txt, from https://github.com/mustafa0x/quran-morphology, an
 * Arabic-script transliteration of the Quranic Arabic Corpus v0.4, (c) Kais Dukes, GNU GPL -
 * kept verbatim as downloaded, see its header for the license/attribution terms): every Qur'an
 * word is pre-split into prefix/stem/suffix segments, and each stem segment is tagged with its
 * dictionary LEMMA and (usually) its ROOT.
 *
 * Matching happens in two normalization tiers, tried in order, because stripping *all* short
 * vowels (as the first version of this script did) is a double-edged sword: it's necessary to
 * unify inflected surface forms with a lemma, but it also erases distinctions that are the
 * *entire difference* between two unrelated words - e.g. "مَنْ" (man, "who") and "مِنْ" (min,
 * "from") both collapse to "من", and would otherwise get assigned to whichever study entry
 * happened to be processed first, mislabeling thousands of the loser's real occurrences:
 *
 *   1. "Light" matching keeps *stem-internal* short vowels and only strips the ones that are
 *      grammatically non-distinctive rather than part of a word's identity: a word-final case
 *      vowel/sukun/tanween (i'rāb - it marks grammatical role, not word identity, and the study
 *      deck and the morphology corpus disagree constantly on whether to write it at all, e.g.
 *      deck "مَنْ" vs. corpus lemma "مَن"), and a hamzat waṣl's contextual opening vowel (the
 *      elidable connecting hamza that opens verb forms VII/VIII/X, e.g. deck "اِهْتَدَى" vs.
 *      corpus lemma "اهْتَدَى"). That wasl strip applies only to a leading bare alef / hamzat
 *      waṣl (ا / ٱ) - not to alef-with-hamza (أ / إ), whose opening vowel *is* the word: "إِلَّا"
 *      ("except") vs "أَلَّا" ("that not"), "إِنَّ" vs "أَنَّ". Every *stem-internal* vowel
 *      survives, so homographs distinguished only by an internal vowel - like "مَنْ" ("man",
 *      who) vs. "مِنْ" ("min", from) - still resolve correctly instead of colliding.
 *   2. "Heavy" matching (strip all short vowels) is only used as a fallback for a study word
 *      that light matching found zero occurrences for, and only when that heavy-normalized
 *      token isn't *also* the heavy form of some other, distinct study word - an ambiguous
 *      fallback is dropped rather than guessed at.
 *
 * Root-family expansion (tag every word sharing a matched word's root, e.g. unifying "هَدَى" and
 * "اهتدى") only ever runs off of confidently-seeded matches, and only when every seed agrees on
 * a single root, so it can't itself introduce a cross-word mix-up.
 *
 * A handful of study words are citation *phrases* rather than single words (e.g. "لَا إِلهَ" "no
 * god", "بَيْنَ يَدَيْ" "in front of") - these are never matched as a contiguous run of adjacent
 * Qur'an words. Instead, each space-separated word in the citation is registered as its own
 * ordinary single-word candidate under the same id (see loadStudyForms), so a learner who
 * recognizes just one piece of the phrase (most usefully "لَا" "no/not", which also happens to be
 * one of the most common words in the whole Qur'an) has it hidden everywhere *that* word appears,
 * not only in the rarer spots it happens to sit next to the phrase's other word. Because a
 * split-off word like that is auto-derived rather than a real, deliberately-taught deck entry, it
 * always defers outright to a genuine single-word study entry for the exact same text should one
 * exist elsewhere in the deck (e.g. "06-012" "لَوْ لَا" "if not for" also splits off a "لَوْ" token,
 * but "12-011" already teaches bare "لَوْ" "if" on its own and keeps every occurrence of it).

  // broad top-up for every already-seeded word caused real cross-word mislabeling in testing.

  // from that as light matching already is, while still closing this narrower gap. Since this is
  // a *supplementary* top-up (only ever adding occurrences, never reassigning ones pass 1/2

/**
 * Fallback pass, run *after* `buildVocabMatches`: for every Qur'an word position that still has
 * no curated study-word match, but does have a resolvable Qur'anic Arabic Corpus dictionary
 * lemma, generates a stable, deterministic id ("lem:<lightLemma>") grouping every occurrence of
 * that same lemma. This lets a user who already knows a word *outside* the 547-word curriculum
 * still mark it "known" once (see `useKnownWordsStore`) and have every occurrence of that word
 * recognized across the whole Qur'an, the same way curriculum mastery already works via
 * `ReaderWord.v` + `getMasteredVocabIds`.
 *
 * A lemma is skipped entirely (left untagged, same as today) only if a *majority* of its
 * occurrences already belong to a curated match: that signals the matcher believes this lemma is
 * essentially one of the 547 study words already, and minting a second, competing id for its
 * leftover occurrences - usually ones deliberately left unseeded by buildVocabMatches's
 * ambiguity/POS-splitting logic - would fragment one real-world word into two different "known"
 * ids instead of one.
 *
 * A simple "any occurrence claims the whole lemma" rule is too aggressive: the corpus sometimes
 * lemmatizes an unrelated curated word under the same LEM tag as a much more common word purely
 * as a morphological quirk (e.g. the attention particle "أَلَا" - study word 07-006 - shares the
 * corpus lemma "لا" with the everyday negation particle "لَا", even though a learner would never
 * consider them the same word). Requiring a majority means those rare, low-overlap collisions no
 * longer block fallback tagging for the lemma's hundreds of other, unrelated occurrences.
 *
 * The id itself is just the corpus's own light-normalized LEM tag text (not a heavy-normalized or
 * index-based id), so it's both deterministic across rebuilds and distinguishes true homographs
 * the way light matching already does elsewhere in this file (e.g. "مَنْ" vs "مِنْ" get different
 * lemma ids, not the same one).
